Azure Callback URLs

	In Azure, a callback URL (or redirect URI) is a URL that is used during the authentication process to redirect users 
	back to your application after they have successfully authenticated with an identity provider. 
	This is commonly used in scenarios involving OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect, where users are authenticated through 
	services like Azure Active Directory (Azure AD).

	Here’s a breakdown of how it typically works:

		- User Requests Authentication: A user attempts to access a resource or service that requires authentication.
		- Redirect to Identity Provider: The user is redirected to an identity provider (like Azure AD) to log in.
		- Authenticate User: The user logs in and the identity provider authenticates the user.
		- Redirect Back to Application: After authentication, the identity provider redirects the user back to your 
		application using the callback URL provided during the setup.

	Why Callback URLs are Important:
		- Security: Callback URLs ensure that tokens or authentication codes are sent to the correct location. 
		 This helps prevent interception and misuse.
		- Application State: They allow the application to handle the response and potentially pass any state or 
		additional parameters needed by the application.

	Configuring Callback URLs in Azure:
		
		When registering an application in Azure Active Directory, you need to specify the callback URLs where 
		the identity provider should redirect after authentication. This is done in the Azure portal:

			- Register Your Application: In the Azure portal, go to "Azure Active Directory" > "App registrations" 
				and select your application.

			- Configure Redirect URIs: Under the "Authentication" section, you can add or configure the redirect URIs
				that your application will use.

	Key Points to Remember:

		- Exact Matching: Ensure that the redirect URIs configured in Azure AD exactly match the URIs used by your 
		application to avoid errors.

		- Multiple URIs: You can specify multiple redirect URIs if your application has different endpoints for 
		different environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

	Overall, callback URLs are a crucial part of the authentication flow, ensuring that users are returned to the correct 
	application with the proper authentication context.
