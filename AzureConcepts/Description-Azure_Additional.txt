Azure Advisor -

	Its a service that will monitor other service and suggest the best practices.
	For resources such as SQL, Web, VM we might need suggestions on Opertion Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance and Cost.

Azure Cost Management + Billing -

	This tool will analysis cost and suggest optimization on cost for a project required resources.
	
	1. On opening -> The dashboard will show. On the dashboard the cost on the basis of subscription will be shown.
	
	2. We can select the subscription. On opening on the LHS panel we can see 
		Cost Management -> Cost analysis, Cost alerts, Budgets, Advisor Recommendations.
		a. Cost analysis - High level view of the cost associated with the subscription in the current billing period, 
		data granuality and grouping. 
		b. Budgets - We can set some budget and will get notified if the cost exceeds the budget.
		c. Cost Alerts - The alerts gets triggered when budget rule are met or violated.
		d. Advisor Recommendations

	3. We can also select a resource and check the similar parameters of Cost management.

Azure Monitor -

	Alert Rule - We can write an alert rule based upon some metric.
		a. A metric can be resource utilization or another can be based on data from AppInsights. Here we need to write KQL to fetch data.
		b. Once the data is available we need to check the granuility i.e range of data on which the Alert Rule will run + the check frequency.
		Ex - Granuility = 24 hours and Frequency of Evaluation = 5 mins. This will check the data in the range of 24 hours with the check logic 
		checking every 5 mins
		c. Once the check logic is set, we need to add Action Group to perform any real action. This can be mapped later also.
		d. Need to add any Tags if needed. 
		e. Save it. And the Alert rule is active.

	Action Group - This represents a Action bundle. They will trigger some action for any Alert Rule invocation.
		a. We can have notification for some Emails, Sms, Resource Manager role etc.
		b. Also we can have action to invoke multiple other resources like Azure Function, ITSM, Automation Runbook, LogicApp, Webhook etc.
		So if the Alert Rule is mapped to Action Group then when Alert is invoked the Action Group will either trigger Notification or Actions.

	Alert Processing Rule - Alert processing rules allow you to apply processing on fired alerts. Alert processing rules are different from
		alert rules. Alert rules generate new alerts that notify you when something happens, while alert processing rules modify the 
		fired alerts as they're being fired to change the usual alert behavior.

		You can use alert processing rules to add action groups or remove (suppress) action groups from your fired alerts.
		They are helpful during scheduled maintenance.

Azure RBAC (Role Based Access Control)

	- This works with priviledge identity management (PIM).
	Here we have a concept of Security Principle. This can be attached to Users, Groups, Service Principle and Managed Identity.
	Each user must have a role to access a resource. So each role is assigned with a security principle.
	- Generally we can have reader and contributor/editor role. Apart from that we can have custom roles.
	- Once the resource idetity (both the managed identity and the service principle) is added to a resource as reader or contributor
	the resource will be able to read or update the resource.
