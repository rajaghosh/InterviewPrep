This project is about Repository Pattern.

Repository Pattern states the DB implementation must be decoupled from Business or any above layer.
As Such we bring an extra layer of Abstaction using "Interface". Which says we would call the DB using the interface instance.
For our task if needed we can inject the interface with actual implementation class in StartUp.cs

In the current project we have 2 DB implementation (In Models) -> EmployeeRepositoryLocal and EmployeeRepositorySQL.
Currently we used EmployeeRepositorySQL as DependencyInjection.
If needed we can use the EmployeeRepositoryLocal.
This wont cause any issue as above layers are implements the interface members. So the method template wont cause any issue.

Connectivity:
1. We have used a Employee.cs Model to be inserted in the DB
2. We have another Model Dept.cs but that is not updated in DB, as the details are not there in the AppDBContext.cs DBset.
3. WebApi Controller is present in "EmployeeController".
