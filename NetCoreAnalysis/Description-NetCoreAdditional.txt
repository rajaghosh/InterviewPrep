Advantage of .NET Core 6 over .NET Core 3.1

    1. Performance Improvements - .NET 6 includes significant performance enhancements, making it one of the fastest frameworks available. 
    This can lead to faster application response times and better resource utilization.
    
    2. Unified Platform - .NET 6 unifies the .NET ecosystem by combining .NET Core, Xamarin, and Mono into a single framework. 
    This simplifies development and deployment across different platforms.

    3. Minimal APIs - Introduced in .NET 6, minimal APIs allow for the creation of lightweight HTTP APIs with less boilerplate code. 
    This makes it easier and faster to develop microservices and small web applications.

    4. Hot Reload - Hot Reload in .NET 6 enables developers to make changes to the source code while the application is running and
    see the changes immediately. This feature enhances productivity by reducing the need to restart applications during development.

    5. Improved Cloud-Native Support - .NET 6 has enhanced support for building cloud-native applications, including better integration
    with Docker and Kubernetes. This makes it easier to develop, deploy, and manage applications in cloud environments.

    6. Long-Term Support (LTS) - Like .NET Core 3.1, .NET 6 is an LTS version, ensuring it receives support and updates for three years. 
    This provides stability and security for long-term projects.

    7. Enhanced Development Experience - .NET 6 includes various improvements to the development experience, such as better tooling, diagnostics,
    and debugging capabilities. These enhancements help developers write, test, and maintain code more efficiently.
