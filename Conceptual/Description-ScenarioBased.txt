Q. The API is supposed to handle 100000 request. How you can handle the situation? [Huge User Traffic Scenario]

	Ans - Testing for API performance in the lowers.
	We need to run API performance test. Primarily the following tests:
	a. Load Test - Helpful during scenarios of constant traffic.
	b. Stress Test - Helpful during scenarios of constant traffic, with slow increase in requests.
	c. Spike Test - Helpful during scenarios where suddenly the traffic increases.
	d. Soak Test - Helpful during scenarios of memory leak, which is causing slowness in the application. 
	Here we need to run the API for certain period of time to record stable response time.
